            <p class="story-text">
                I got my start at Webedia Group, creating animated ads for sites like IGN,
                AdoroCinema, and TudoGostoso. Back then it was all Flash—but I helped lead
                the shift to CSS and jQuery animations to make things faster and more
                SEO-friendly. Working with big names like EA, Ubisoft, and movie studios
                gave me a front-row seat to high-impact digital campaigns. After that, I spent
                time as a visual designer at an ad agency and then at CNN, where I worked on
                creative projects and helped keep the site fresh with content, especially during
                elections. Most recently, I’ve been a web developer for a Korean healthcare 
                company, building their Brazilian site, launching new products, and keeping their
                blog up to date.
